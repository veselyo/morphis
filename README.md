# A Context-Aware AI for Dynamic Interior Morphing in Fully Automated Vehicles
The mobility of the future with fully automated vehicles enables a complete rethinking of in-vehicle user spaces and interactions. We present an adaptive in-terior concept called MORPHISin which a cooperative AI assistant continuously senses external influences (e.g., traffic density, notifications), vehicle state (e.g., charge level, range), and passenger condition (e.g., fatigue, mood) to dynamically morph physical and virtual cabin elements. To illustrate this concept, we simulate a scenario where five contextual inputs (sleepiness, work urgency, health stress, route distance, and email activity) drive a machine-learning model predicting op-timal  seat  angle  adjustments.  Synthetic  data  spanning  these  factors  are  used  to train  a  two-stage  regression  network.Early  results  demonstrate  mean  absolute error of ~2° in angle prediction and clear sensitivity to contextual triggers. We foresee extending this framework to examples like climateandlighting anden-vision multi-modalsensor data fusionfor stable and precise AI suggestions, driv-ing higher acceptance and competitive advantage for automotive OEMs.
