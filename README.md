## MORPHIS: A Context-Aware AI for Dynamic Interior Morphing in Fully Automated Vehicles
The mobility of the future with fully automated vehicles enables a complete rethinking of in-vehicle user spaces and interactions. We present an adaptive interior concept called MORPHIS in which a cooperative AI assistant continuously senses external influences (e.g., traffic density, notifications), vehicle state (e.g., charge level, range), and passenger condition (e.g., fatigue, mood) to dynamically morph physical and virtual cabin elements. To illustrate this concept, we simulate a scenario where five contextual inputs (sleepiness, work urgency, health stress, route distance, and email activity) drive a machine-learning model predicting optimal seat angle adjustments. Synthetic data spanning these factors are used to train a two-stage regression network. Early results demonstrate mean absolute error of ~2° in angle prediction and clear sensitivity to contextual triggers. We foresee extending this framework to examples like climate and lighting and envision multi-modal sensor data fusion for stable and precise AI suggestions, driving higher acceptance and competitive advantage for automotive OEMs.
